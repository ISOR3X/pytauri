# PyTauri

[Tauri] bindings for Python through [PyO3]

PyTauri is an alternative to [pywebview] and [pystray], leveraging Tauri's comprehensive features to offer Python developers a GUI framework and a batteries-included development experience similar to [electron] and [PySide]. It is inspired by [FastAPI] and [Pydantic], aiming to offer a similar development experience.

Through [Pyo3], Rust developers can better utilize the Python ecosystem (e.g. building AI GUI applications with [PyTorch]). Although Rust's lifetime and ownership system makes Rust code safer, Python's garbage collection will make life easier.

- ðŸ”„ Seamless communication between your favorite web framework and python thanks to Tauri  and PyO3
- ðŸ”‹Use tauri plugins such as notifications and dialogs to create a full native app experience
- ðŸ“¦ Package your entire app into a single, standalone executable for easy distribution across platforms
- âš¡Enjoy a great developer experience with hot reloading both python and your frontend
- ðŸ¦€ Rust knowledge optional! `pytauri-wheel` is a precompiled version of pytauri which allows you to use pytauri without having a Rust compiler
- ðŸ”— Can be integrated with [nicegui], [gradio] or [FastAPI] to achieve a full-stack Python development experience (e.g. without `Node.js`).

### Used By

Although PyTauri is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to make cool projects:
